This project will require a few things:

- 3+ scenes (not counting intro/outro slides or others used only for fading effects)
    
- 2+ audio assets (such as .wav files)
    - I made two audio files using Apple's GarageBand 
- 2+ image assets (such as .png files)
    - The 2 images were sketched in Adobe Illustrator (free via school email on Adobe Creative Cloud)
- 2+ geometric shapes
    - created using Phasers graphics()
- 1+ logotype text (either as a Google Slides text object or embedded image file)
    - Start Screen
- 1+ multi-line text block
    - the credits were on this one
- 1+ fading scene transition (e.g. fade to black)
    - I included two fade to black transitions because I liked the way it transitioned into GameSceneTwo
- 1+ object motion animation (e.g. sliding in)
    - Ghost 1 & Ghost 2 slid into the middle
    - Square & Circle slid into the frame
